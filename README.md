## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- javascript

### What I learned

This was a real challenge to me because of the card layouts, it was difficult to me putting all together, I learn a lot about positioning and css grid.

### Continued development

I wan to learn more about this kind of odd positioning, I think I can get better with that, I also want to improve my responsive design skills.
